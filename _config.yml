        description: |
          This project investigates the detection of exoplanets using machine learning, specifically employing the K-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm to analyze light intensity data. Utilizing a dataset downloaded from Kaggle, which includes light curves of various celestial bodies, we focus on identifying patterns indicative of exoplanets. The k-NN model is trained on labeled data to distinguish between exoplanets and non-exoplanetary candidates based on fluctuations in light intensity. Our findings demonstrate that k-NN can effectively enhance classification accuracy, providing a promising avenue for future research in exoplanet detection and contributing to our understanding of planetary systems beyond our solar system.
